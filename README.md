# ppg-py

ppg.py is a command-line tool to generate passphrases, based on the 
diceware method described at http://www.diceware.com.  Instead of using 
dice, ppg.py uses a cryptographically secure random
number generator, as briefly described at
http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/dicewarefaq.html#computer, to pick
random words from a given word list to compose a passphrase.


## Why passphrases?

TL;DR - Go read this XKCD comic: https://xkcd.com/936/

From http://www.diceware.com:

> Passphrases differ from passwords only in length. Passwords are
  usually short, six to ten characters.... Passphrases are usually
  much longer -- typically 25 to 64 characters (including
  spaces). Their greater length makes passphrases more secure. Modern
  passphrases were invented by Sigmund N. Porter in 1982.
>
> Picking a good passphrase is one of the most important things you
  can do to preserve the privacy of your computer data and e-mail
  messages. A passphrase should be:
>
> - Known only to you
> - Long enough to be secure
> - Hard to guess -- even by someone who knows you well
> - Easy for you to remember
> - Easy for you to type accurately


Research published in 2012 also found that "a password-composition
policy requiring long passwords with no other restrictions provides
(relative to other tested policies) excellent resistance to guessing"
(Kelley, Patrick Gage, Saranga Komanduri, Michelle L Mazurek, Richard
Shay, Timothy Vidas, Lujo Bauer, Nicolas Christin, Lorrie Faith
Cranor, and Julio Lopez. “Guess Again (and Again and Again): Measuring
Password Strength by Simulating Password-Cracking Algorithms.” In
Security and Privacy (SP), 2012 IEEE Symposium On, 523–537. IEEE,
2012. Available at:
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/6233637/6234400/06234434.pdf).

Citing that paper among many others, the U.S. government revised
their password recommendations in 2017 to emphasize password length
and memorability over password complexity. From NIST SP 800-63B
(https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html):

> Password length has been found to be a primary factor in characterizing 
> password strength.... Users should be encouraged to make their passwords 
> as lengthy as they want, within reason. Since the size of a hashed password 
> is independent of its length, there is no reason not to permit the use of 
> lengthy passwords (or pass phrases) if the user wishes. 


## Why another passphrase generator?

- I like the diceware approach and explanation for generating passphrases.
- I want an off-line solution whose security I can verify.  I can't verify a
web-based solution, even if it's based on open-source software, as I can't 
verify the deployment.  ppg.py is around 50 lines of python3 code and is
relatively straight-forward to verify. Python 3 is also readily available,
as it comes installed by default in most Linux distributions and is bundled 
with Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS.

## Usage

ppg.py requires Python 3.

```
usage: ppg.py [-h] [-w WORD_COUNT] [-n PHRASE_COUNT] [-d] [-s] file

positional arguments:
  file                  word list, one word per line

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w WORD_COUNT, --word_count WORD_COUNT
                        number of words in the passphrase (default is 5)
  -n PHRASE_COUNT, --phrase_count PHRASE_COUNT
                        number of passphrases to generate (default is 20)
  -d, --digit           adds a single digit at a random place in the passphrase
  -s, --special         adds a single special character at a random place in the passphrase
```

Digits used for the -d|--digit argument are digits 2-9; digits 0 and 1 are avoided to
prevent confusion with the letters o and l.

As of version 1.0.0, the special characters used with the -s|--special argument are "!@#$.^*/".


## On the strength of passphrases generated by ppg.py

The strength of the passphrase depends on the size of the word file and the number
of words in the passphrase.

To guarantee a uniform distribution of random numbers, ppg.py uses the 
largest prefix of the selected word list that is a whole power of two in 
length, following the guidance at 
http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#computer.

Examples:
* The diceware8k.txt file available at 
https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware8k.txt contains exactly 8192 
words, so the entire file is used.
* If another file were specified at the command-line with slightly fewer words,
then only the first 4096 lines of the file would be used. 


## Resources for word lists

Word lists can be constructed from
* the standard diceware files at www.diceware.com  
* https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases
* /usr/share/dict/words on a Unix-like computer

A word list is simply a text file with one word per line, so 
customizing and experimenting with multiple word lists is 
rather straight-forward.


## How to verify the security of a word list

For full security, a word list should have no duplicates 
(see http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/dicewarefaq.html#tampered).

Verifying this condition is a simple matter at a Unix command-line; 
`sort file |uniq -d` shows the duplicate entries from the file, and there 
shouldn't be any.


## Additional security tips

* Use a password manager.
* Use two-factor authentication where available.
